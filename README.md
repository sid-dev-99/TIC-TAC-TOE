# TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic Tac Toe Game:
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This classic two-player game challenges you to strategically place your marks on a 3x3 grid 
and attempt to form a line of three in a row horizontally,vertically, or diagonally.

#How to Play:
The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and each cell is identified by its row and column number (e.g., (1, 1) for 
the top-left cell and (3, 3) for the bottom-right cell).

Two players take turns to play the game. One player uses "X" as their mark, and the other player uses "O" as their mark.
To make a move, players need to input the row and column number of the cell they want to place their mark in.
The game will automatically determine if the move is valid and if the cell is available.
If it is not a valid move (e.g., out of the board's range or the cell is already taken), the player will be prompted to make another move.

The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
One player successfully forms a line of three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.
After the game ends, players have the option to play again or exit the game.
